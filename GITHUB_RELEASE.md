# Creating a GitHub Release

Now that you've pushed your code to GitHub with the v1.0 tag, follow these steps to create a release:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/lloydismael/Py-Portal

2. Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar or navigate to https://github.com/lloydismael/Py-Portal/releases

3. Click on "Create a new release" or "Draft a new release"

4. In the "Choose a tag" dropdown, select the existing tag "v1.0"

5. Set the release title to "Reimbursement Portal v1.0"

6. In the description field, copy and paste the content from CHANGELOG.md for v1.0:

```
### Added
- Initial release of the Reimbursement Portal application
- User authentication with role-based access (Employee, Finance, Manager)
- Reimbursement request workflow with approval and processing steps
- File sharing with QR code generation
- Profile management features
- Philippine Peso (â‚±) as the default currency
- Modern UI with Azure blue theme and glass-like design

```

7. If you have any binary assets to include with your release (such as compiled executables or packages), you can upload them in the "Attach binaries" section.

8. Click "Publish release" to make it public.

Your Reimbursement Portal project is now properly versioned and has its first official release on GitHub!
